# x86-64 instruction encodings in a machine readable format

This is a [very work in progress](Todo.md) attempt to make an extremely simple database of the x86-64 instruction encodings in an easily machine and human readable format (tsv)

The encodings are presented basically the same as in the Intel manuals, a more in depth explanation is provided in [Schema.md](Schema.md)
